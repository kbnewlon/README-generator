AS A developer
I WANT a README generator
SO THAT can quickly create a professional README for a new project

LINK TO WALKTHROUGH

SAMPLE READ ME PIC

Description: This is a Node CLI used for creating READMEs


Your task is to create a command-line application that dynamically generates a professional README.md from a user's input using the [Inquirer package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer). Review the [Good README guide](../../01-HTML-Git-CSS/04-Supplemental/Good-README-Guide/README.md) as a reminder of everything that a quality, professional README contains. The application will be invoked with the following command:

```
node index.js
```

Because this is a command-line application that won’t be deployed, you’ll also need to provide a link to a walkthrough video that demonstrates the functionality of your application. Revisit the Screencastify Tutorial in the prework as a refresher on how to record video from your computer.






## Submission Requirements

Because this is a CLI App, there will be no need to deploy it to Heroku. This time, though, you need to include a video showing us that you got the app working with no bugs. You should include a link to the video in your application's `README.md` file.

* Create a `.gitignore` file and include `node_modules/` and `.DS_Store/`.

* `node_modules` is not tracked and uploaded to GitHub. (Hint: It is easy if you create your `.gitignore` file before installing dependencies with npm.)

* Repo **MUST** include `package.json` with required dependencies. (Hint: Run `npm init` when you first setup the project before installing any dependencies.)

* Include a video of the typical user flow through your application. This includes views of the prompts and the responses after their selection.

* Include any other screenshots you deem necessary to help someone who has never been introduced to your application understand the purpose and function of it. This is how you will communicate to potential employers/other developers in the future what you built and why, and to show how it works.

* Because screenshots (and well-written READMEs) are extremely important in the context of GitHub, this will be part of the grading.


## Submission on BCS

You are required to submit the following:

* A walkthrough video demonstrating the functionality of the application. 

* A sample README.md file for a project repository generated using your application.

* The URL of the GitHub repository. Give the repository a unique name and include a README describing the project.
